This is the GitHub repository for the workshop series called **Demystifying R and RStudio**, given at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) by Arcus Education.

## About This Workshop Series

Welcome to Demystifying R and RStudio! 

This series is intended to be a gentle introduction to R and RStudio for people who interact with  data and want to work in the R statistical programming language (or just understand what it is and why it matters). This course is geared towards beginners who are comfortable doing basic tasks with data that comes in rows and columns (for example, organizing data in Excel) but have no programming background.
 
The series will cover why and how to get started using the R statistical programming language in your work. We'll talk the definition of R (a programming language), RStudio (a software environment useful for working with the R language), how to access and use these tools, and next steps for learning how to use them.  What we won't do is show you how to get started writing code or analyzing data using R.  So if you just want to get an overall idea of what R and RStudio are all about, without actually doing hands-on coding, this is the perfect workshop series for you!

## Workshop Sessions

Material in later sessions does build on work done in earlier sessions, but don't let missing a session keep you away from attending later sessions.  We try to overlap material to help keep everyone caught up!

  * Considerations for working with R and RStudio at CHOP
  * Posit.Cloud

- **Session 2: Literate Statistical Programming**

  * Review of R and RStudio
