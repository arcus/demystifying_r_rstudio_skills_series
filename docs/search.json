I’d like to begin by briefly introducing myself and introducing Arcus, for those of you who may not be familiar with us. My name is ______ (add pronouns here if you want), and I’ll be leading today’s session.\nArcus is an initiative by the Research Institute aimed at promoting data discovery and reuse and increasing research reproducibility throughout the research lifecycle, as you can see in the graphic on the right. [Pause]\nChanging the paradigm of research is a big undertaking, and it requires a broad approach.\nWe aim to improve data reuse and research reproducibility at CHOP through technology, including Arcus labs and applied data science, through the use of data archiving and cataloging, and by way of education.\nYou can find out more by checking out the Arcus application website (please note, there are some pre-requisites to using the app, such as human subjects protection training and signing our terms of use). I’ve added just a very small screenshot of part of what the Arcus application website looks like on the slide on the left side. [Pause].\nYou can also, without restriction or any prerequisites, look at our Arcus Sharepoint site, which has a calendar of events and lots more information about Arcus.\nA little more about me: I work in Arcus Education. Our role is to support CHOP scientists by helping researchers acquire data science skills. That’s why we have Skills Series like this one!"

We work one on one with researchers in office hours, we write how-to guides to help people understand how to use Arcus tools, we create asynchronous modules that people can use to acquire skills in their own time, and we do synchronous events like this one.\nSometimes we focus on Arcus customers, on researchers at CHOP who are doing research within the Arcus data sharing paradigm, and sometimes we broaden our reach to larger audiences, because we know that helping everyone acquire data science skills will help improve the conduct of science at CHOP and help build a data-driven workforce.\nPlease check out that page and find out more about some of our services. You can see I’ve added a screenshot of that page to the slide here on the left side. You can also email us at arcus dash education at chop dot edu."

Don’t worry, there won’t be a quiz!\nYou can see that there are some comments, here shown in grey, that describe what the code is doing. As I scroll down, you can see what this code does.\nFirst, we’re ingesting some data from REDCap. It’s a survey we give related to a webinar we give twice a month, called Arcus 101. We want to measure our effectiveness, and we analyze this survey data using R.\nSo we ingest the data,\nIn line 9, we get rid of a value we don’t need.\nThen we do some transformation. We want to make sure R knows the proper order of our Likert scale values. We have a set of values that has to do with knowledge, a set of values that has to do with opinion before our talk, and a set of values that has to do with opinion after our talk.\nIn lines 36 and 37, we do a little math to measure change.\nThen we make a data visualization in lines 42 through 46, and in line 50, we save this as a file we can use later.\nThis is just a snippet of actual code that we use in our team, just in case you’ve never seen R code before."

Because learning to write a programming language can be hard, there are lots of online communities where people help each other out and ask questions. R is similar to other programming languages in these ways.\nBut R is special as a programming language when we’re talking about data. While all programming languages can work with data, R was designed specifically for data analysis. That means that that R is really quite good for data analysis, and it’s not good for, say, programming robots."

    "text": "Why Does This Matter?\n\n\nWhich is a better tool?\n\nA multi-tool (like a Swiss Army knife)\nA mostly mono-task tool (like a cherry pitter)\n\n\n “Stainless 2CR Multi-tool”, Santeri Viinamäki, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nThere are programming languages that can do lots of stuff reasonably well. Python is one. With Python, you can make a website, or program a robot, or analyze data, or make a desktop application, or build an API. You can get lots of different attachments, or libraries, to make the language more useful. That’s great if you’re an experienced programmer and you need to do lots of different things. It seems like a multi-purpose language would be the best choice for most people, right?\nWell, one thing to consider is when you’re a beginner. When you’re learning something for the first time, it can be a lot easier to learn how to use a tool that mostly just does one thing. If you’re using code to do data analysis, and you’re searching online for tutorials, it can be very frustrating to watch a bunch of tutorials that end up being about how to program robots or do other things that you don’t care about. Because R is a very tightly scoped solution to the problem of data analysis, everyone who is posting about R on the internet is interested in data analysis, and you’ll have a lot easier time finding answers to your questions about how to use it.\nSo, to answer the question on this slide… which is better? It depends! We think – and it’s just our opinion – that for people who have to do lots of different things, a multi-tool, a language that has lots of uses, like Python, might be a better fit. And we suspect that for beginners, a very focused tool like the R language might be a better fit as you get started."

    "text": "Why Not Just Use Excel?\n“Why even write code?\nPoint and click is easier!”\n\nExcel\nPoint and click statistical analysis software (e.g. SPSS, SAS)\n\n\nHere’s a question you might be asking:\nWhy do people even bother to learn how to write code? After all, there are software programs out there that allow you to use point and click to analyze your data. Many people use Excel for day-to-day data analysis, and for scientific-grade statistical analysis, there’s always programs like SPSS or SAS or Stata.\nAnd we think that a lot of this depends on how often you’re going to do a particular analysis and if you have to share it, and with whom.\nIf you’re going to do something once, or very infrequently, and it’s just for you or for a few people, for example, let’s say it’s your annual budget, just do a spreadsheet in Excel. No need to write code to do a one-off thing.\nHowever, if you’re going to need to repeat your analysis over and over again, or have someone else do it, think about the steps you take. Will it be hard to describe exactly what cell to put data in, and how to click and drag the values in just the right way? If there are lots of steps and doing things manually is error prone, hard to describe, or just plain annoying, you might be better off writing a script.\nAlso, if you’re going to be sharing your materials beyond your team, you have to think about cost. Excel costs, what, maybe $100? I’m not sure. But other software like SAS or Matlab or SPSS can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, and if you are using that software and sharing your files with someone who doesn’t have the program, you may be making their life complicated. One of the great things about R is that it’s a free, open source language that people around the world use. It’s very popular and anyone can download and use it for free."

This could be something like removing outliers or combining data from two or more sources.\nReporting statistical characteristics. Maybe you want to find quartiles or median values for your data.\nConducting statistical tests. If you do research, you might need to do something like a two-sample t-tests or measure Cohen’s effect size.\nCreating models.

Perhaps you want to save a deidentified version of data, or a cleaned up version for senior leadership.\nCreating data visualizations like scatter plots or box plots\nCommunicating information like making a dashboard for leadership or a table for a scientific publication.\n\nR allows you to write a script where you instruct the computer in how to do each step of this process.\nWriting a script in a coding language like R is hard, but once it’s done, you can have a script that does all the steps of your analysis without having any manual intervention.

    "section": "Why Scripts?",
    "text": "Why Scripts?\n\n\nIn science, we’ve been hearing a lot lately about the “reproducibility crisis”.\nIt’s hard to re-do other people’s analyses… both for checking their work and for trying it in a new situation. This is bad for science!\nOne of the most important reasons to learn R is to improve the reproducibility of your work. One of the most powerful aspects of working in the R environment is that it makes it straightforward to produce reproducible data analyses, which will reduce risk and make “future you” much happier.\n\nCredit: “The Difference”, XKCD, CC A-NC 2.5\nJoy waiting on permission for cartoon permission for cartoon from https://www.himelblau.com/cartoons/science-and-the-lab… in the meantime…\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m going to talk about the reproducibility crisis here. Give me a thumbs up emoji if you’re already familiar with this term.\nNow, I know not everyone on this call might work principally in research, so I want to start by saying that one of the important things in science is that we have to repeat experiments to see if we see things happen over and over again. And that’s because sometimes we see experimental results that are just coincidences or luck.\nIf we see that a certain type of therapy reduces anxiety in one study, we want to see that it works again and again. We want to try it in adolescents, and in adults, and in city kids, and in rural communities, and we’d like to see it work in English speakers and maybe outside of the USA, and in groups with different socio-economic backgrounds, etc. That’s part of how science works. We repeat experiments.\nWe try the same things in different populations. We want to see if the same drug works similarly in men and in women, and in people of various weights, and different comorbid conditions.\nIt’s helpful if different scientists in different organizations and in different parts of the world can show that they’re seeing the same effects. It means increasing scientific evidence.\nThe “reproducibility crisis” refers to the problem in peer-reviewed research in which studies cannot be redone, cannot be reproduced, maybe because of insufficient information on how to redo them, or maybe because of preventable problems in the initial research.\nScience usually has a long, multi-step process for gathering and analyzing data, and any multi-step process can be prone to error. It can be prone to error even when you yourself are doing the exact same analysis three months later when a new batch of data comes in! And it’s even more error prone when someone who isn’t you is trying to understand your notes and how you did things.\nThat’s why having an automated script, which handles all of the steps without human intervention, can be really very helpful. And when we’re in an economy where we have to do more with less, doing it for free, without an expensive license, is really useful, especially if you want to share your findings with colleagues in lower-resourced settings.\nWe’ll talk more about reproducibility in the second session of this two-webinar series, where we talk about literate statistical programming, so if this is interesting to you, please come back for the second talk!"

    "text": "R Vs RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR Programming language for data analysis\n\nRStudio Integrated development environment (IDE)\n\n\nHopefully you understand why sometimes, for at least some people, working with R to write scripts for data analysis makes sense. It can save time and make their work more reproducible and shareable in the long run. Now I want to distinguish between two very similar terms.\nThe first is R. R is a statistical programming language that’s great for doing data analysis. We’ve already talked about a few things that make R useful:\n\nR was built specifically for statistical data analysis, so it’s got a friendly and focused user community and lots of great online resources for learning.\nR is open source, which means that it is “free” in two ways – in the meaning of having no cost and also in that can be used widely without intellectual property concerns or licensing restrictions.\nR makes it possible to work with data and build scripts that do lots of things, from ingesting data to building data visualizations.\n\nThen, there’s RStudio. RStudio was the original name of a company as well as the name of a piece of software the company makes (and makes available in both free and paid versions). A couple of years ago, the company changed its name from RStudio to Posit, but they kept the old name on their software.\nYou can think of RStudio (the software) as a fancy text editor for writing R code. The technical term for a fancy text editor for writing code is “Integrated Development Environment”, or I-D-E. You can run RStudio on Mac, Windows, or Linux. It can run on a local computer like your laptop, or on a server that is accessed using a web browser.\nYou don’t have to use RStudio to write R, but it makes it a lot easier. Think about typing a paper in Microsoft Word. You don’t need to use Word, necessarily. If you didn’t have Microsoft Word, you could write down your thoughts in Notepad, or in a blank Outlook email, or in the Notes app on your phone. But Microsoft Word has lots of add-ons, like spell-check and word count and formatting that make it much more pleasant to write a paper there, rather than in the notes app on your phone!"

It’s not a terrible application, but it doesn’t have many features. On the left, you can see what the R application by itself looks like.\nPosit is a company that is separate from the people who are in charge of the R language, but they make a fantastic piece of software that we strongly recommend, called RStudio. It’s free, and you can see RStudio on the right.\nRStudio has lots of included features that make working in R a lot easier, and most everyone who works in R uses RStudio to write their code. We highly recommend you use it!\nIn the next slide, I’ll show you an animation of what working with just plain R looks like, so you can get a baseline feel for what that’s like, and then in the following slide I’ll show you what it can look like to work with RStudio, so you can appreciate the difference."

This kind of report creation is a big reason why people use RStudio. RStudio supports the creation of dashboards and reports that help you not only analyze your data, but communicate what you’ve discovered to different kinds of audiences effectively. If you want to learn more about that, come to the next talk in this series, called literate statistical programming."

At this point, if you’re not already following along in the slides, I’m going to really encourage you to grab this slide link because this slide and the next will have important information that will be useful for you when you decide to work with R and RStudio.\nEven though all of these software are free, you’ll need a Cost Center (or grant fund) to add to your request. Get that from your manager, administrative staff, or other leadership within your area. There will be no charge, but DTS uses this information for tracking resource utilization. You’ll be asked if this is software that’s already in use at CHOP – it certainly is. You’ll be asked to provide a justification, and that’s usually that you need this to do data analysis for your job. And finally, you’ll have to provide information about your workstation, including the MAC address of your computer."

    "text": "What To Get Installed\nWhat I recommend you install / get installed on your own CHOP device:\n\nR – the language we use to clean, analyze, and visualize data\nRStudio Desktop – an IDE for writing R\nGit – version control software that will allow you to easily get the latest version of our course materials and will also be helpful for tracking changes in your own projects\nGitHub Desktop – a helper, or “client” software that makes working with Git easier\n\n\nWe’ve already talked about R and RStudio, but I also highly recommend getting Git and GitHub Desktop installed as well. They work really well with RStudio, and even if you’re not ready to work with version control software now, you might want to work with these programs in the future, so it can be helpful to have everything installed all at once. Each of these links can take you to more information about installing these programs, which can be helpful for talking to DTS or your boss."

    "text": "Researchers ONLY at CHOP\n(You’ll need a research cost center to refer to for most of these)\n\nIf you work with the High Performance Compute cluster (HPC or Respublica), you can request an RStudio session by logging in to Interactive Apps and choosing RStudio.\nYou can request a VDI that includes RStudio.\nYou can request an Arcus lab for a well-defined research project you’re planning. The Arcus lab includes RStudio.\n\n\nIf you’re a researcher at CHOP, there are additional places you might want to use R. And keep in mind, I work on the research side, so this is what I know best. If you’re on the clinical or operational side of CHOP and there’s something about working with R and RStudio on your side that I’ve omitted, please let me know so I can update the slides!\nI won’t go into these in detail, but each of these are links that take you to more information. As a researcher, you can request access to the HPC, also known as Respublica, you can request a VDI, or you can request an Arcus lab. All of these can be ways you can get access to R and RStudio without having to install them on your local computer. And especially if you work with very big data, or you do complex, high-memory data modeling, you might have to use some of these resources, if your computer just doesn’t have enough RAM to do the job."

    "text": "Posit.Cloud (be careful!)\nYou can use R and RStudio using online services like https://posit.cloud.\nPosit.cloud is a great place for learning or practice with public datasets, BUT is not a safe or compliant place to put your regulated data.\n\nWhen we teach R and RStudio, it can be next to impossible to deal with everyone’s different kinds of installation issues while they’re trying to get set up and deal with IS, get issues ironed out with their computers and their access permissions, etc.\nThat’s why we usually have brand new students use Posit.cloud to learn R and RStudio. Posit.cloud is an online, cloud based service provided by Posit, the company that makes the RStudio software. It’s really good and reliable! It means that as teachers we can concentrate on our learners really acquiring the skills around R and RStudio, without being bogged down by the fact that some people have Macs, some have PCs, some have admin rights, some don’t, some have R installed, some don’t, some have a very old version of R and they can’t update it, and so on. It makes things a lot easier for teachers and learners.\nHOWEVER! Posit is absolutely NOT an appropriate place for regulated health care data. It’s for practicing and learning using public datasets. If you’re going to use R for CHOP data, you might benefit from learning R and RStudio using Posit.cloud but at the same time start the process of getting R and RStudio installed on your CHOP device so that you can transfer those skills to real-life work right away. Depending on your operating system and what you already have installed, this might be very smooth, or you might have to troubleshoot this a few times with DTS or RIS, so be prepared to be patient."

So before we do questions and answers, we like to make sure to give our learners a poll to see if we made a good use of your time. We’re going to ask if we were effective in reaching our goals today, and those goals are on the screen in order to help you answer that question. Once you answer that poll, feel free to type a question into chat or come off mute and ask to clarify anything I can explain a bit better."
